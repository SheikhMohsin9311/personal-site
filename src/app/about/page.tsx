      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        I'm currently a sophomore pursuing Computer Science and Business Analytics 
        at FLAME University in Pune, where I'm on a merit-based full ride scholarship. 
        My academic journey combines technical depth with interdisciplinary breadth—taking 
        coursework in Philosophy and Public Policy alongside core computer science.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond the classroom, I'm a writer and researcher interested in driving 
        positive change wherever I can. I believe in the power of ideas and their 
        practical application to make meaningful differences in people's lives.
      </p>

      <h2>What Drives Me</h2>

      <p>
        I'm drawn to work where technology meets real-world problems. My interests 
        lie in understanding how data, processes, and algorithms can reduce 
        inefficiencies, enhance accessibility, and solve problems that matter in 
        the short run. I prefer research that's grounded in something tangible—work 
        that creates measurable impact rather than just theoretical exploration.
      </p>

      <p>
        This philosophy extends to my writing. I've written for Deccan Herald with 
        my professor about education policy, and contributed to Kashmir Poetics, 
        a Kashmir-based magazine. Writing helps me think more clearly about complex 
        problems and communicate technical ideas to broader audiences.
      </p>

      <h2>Academic & Extracurricular</h2>

      <p>
        At FLAME, I'm a member of the Dot Slash Club, our university's coding team 
        focused on programming and hackathons. Before university, I attended Jawahar 
        Navodaya Vidyalaya in Kashmir on a merit scholarship, where I served as 
        Extracurricular Head and coordinated the Atal Tinkering Labs, teaching 3D 
        printing to juniors.
      </p>

      <h2>Beyond Academics</h2>

      <p>
        When I'm not coding or writing, you'll find me on the badminton court or 
        in debate competitions. I'm also an avid reader interested in philosophy, 
        public policy, and the intersection of technology with society.
      </p>

      <p>
        Photography teaches me to see the world differently, while debate sharpens 
        my ability to construct and defend arguments—skills that translate well 
        into everything else I do.
