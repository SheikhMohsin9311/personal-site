      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Business Analytics 
        at FLAME University in Pune, where I'm developing a foundation in both 
        technical and analytical thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        My academic work focuses on the practical application of computational 
        methods to real-world challenges. I'm particularly interested in how 
        data analysis and systems design can be used to address inefficiencies 
        in public infrastructure, policy implementation, and organizational processes.
      </p>

      <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>

      <p>
        I'm drawn to projects that sit at the intersection of technology and 
        societal impact. This includes exploring how algorithmic thinking can 
        improve government service delivery, how data can inform evidence-based 
        policy decisions, and how systems thinking can reveal hidden patterns 
        in complex organizational structures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond the classroom, I spend time reading about economics, public policy, 
        and the history of technology. I believe that understanding context and 
        constraints is just as important as technical skill when working on 
        meaningful problems.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Focus</h2>

      <p>
        Right now, I'm developing my skills in statistical analysis, algorithm 
        design, and data visualization. I'm also learning to communicate technical 
        concepts clearly to non-technical audiences—a skill I consider essential 
        for anyone working at the intersection of technology and policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm always interested in connecting with others working on similar problems, 
        whether in academia, government, or the private sector. Feel free to reach 
        out if you'd like to discuss ideas or potential collaborations.
