        I am a student of Computer Science and Business Analytics at FLAME
        University, Pune. My interests lie in using data, algorithms, and
        systems thinking to understand and reduce inefficiencies in real-world
        contexts.

      <p className="mt-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        I am particularly drawn to work at the intersection of technology,
        public policy, and applied research, where computational tools can be
        used to create measurable, grounded impact.
