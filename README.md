# Personal Website

This is my personal website, built to showcase my work at the intersection of Computer Science, Business Analytics, and public policy.

## Overview

The site is designed with a focus on clarity and minimal distraction. It serves as a central place for my writing, professional experience, and contact information. The aesthetic leans toward a dark, focused interface with subtle animations that don't interfere with readability.

## Technical Stack

The site is built using Next.js with TypeScript and styled using a combination of Tailwind CSS and custom CSS. The choice of Next.js allows for straightforward routing and good performance out of the box, while the styling approach keeps things simple and maintainable.

## Structure

The site consists of four main sections:

- **Home**: A brief introduction to my interests and current work
- **About**: More context on my academic background and areas of focus
- **Experience**: Professional and academic experience, including projects and skills
- **Writing**: Articles and thoughts on technology, policy, and applied research

## Design Philosophy

The design prioritizes readability and content over visual complexity. Times New Roman was chosen for its classic, academic feel. The dark theme with purple and pink accents creates visual interest without being distracting. Animations are used sparingly to provide feedback on interactive elements rather than for decoration.

## Setup

To run this locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Customization

Most styling is contained in `globals.css`. The color scheme uses CSS custom properties and can be adjusted there. Page content is in standard Next.js page components under the `app` directory.

## Deployment

This is a standard Next.js application and can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or any platform that supports Next.js.
